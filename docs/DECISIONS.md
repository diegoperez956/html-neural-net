## D-001 (lead) — custom-property netlist architecture verified

Hypothesis: gate-built circuit as typed integer custom-property declarations with interdependent named wires (carry chains) resolves correctly in Chromium.
Experiment: `experiments/lead-vertical/proto.html` — 2-bit ripple adder + 2x2 gate multiplier, @property <integer>, counter display.
Evidence: Playwright Chromium 149, all 16 input states correct for sum, both carries, and product.
Disposition: architecture anchored. Gate basis = min/max/subtract. Workers build on this.
